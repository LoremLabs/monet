		<h2>Basic block level elements</h2>

		<p>
			This is a normal paragraph (<code>p</code> element). To add some length to
			it, let us mention that this page was primarily written for testing the
			effect of <strong>user style sheets</strong>. You can use it for various
			other purposes as well, like just checking how your browser displays
			various HTML elements by default. It can also be useful when testing
			conversions from HTML format to other formats, since some elements can go
			wrong then.
		</p>

		<!-- monet-inline -->
		<monet-inline theme="dark"></monet-inline>

		<p>
			This is another paragraph. I think it needs to be added that the set of
			elements tested is not exhaustive in any sense. I have selected those
			elements for which it can make sense to write user style sheet rules, in
			my opinion.
